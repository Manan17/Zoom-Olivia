          To prepare for the exams, 1) attend the lectures, 2) take notes, 3) read the reading assignment; and 4) do the homework.
          To deliver successful projects, 1) find reliable teammates, 2) start early, 3) work consistently, 4) test my code thoroughly, and
          5) be a self-driven learner.
          Finally, talk to the instructor and TA, early and often.
          Policies
          • No late submission or make-up exams: Late submission of assignment will not be graded.
          There will be absolutely no exception unless it is due to verifiable cases of illness and
          emergencies.
          • Academic integrity: All assignments must be done independently. Academic dishonesty will
          be treated seriously according to the Student Academic Misconduct Procedures.
          Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in,
          be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both
          Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is
          prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the
          basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or
          someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information
          and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.
          As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged
          acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services,
          https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling, is available if you wish discuss any concerns confidentially and
          privately.

          Prerequisites
          Students are expected to have a working knowledge of basic probability theory and linear algebra.
          In addition, proficiency in MATLAB programming is required for the mini-projects.
          Assessment
          Below is a breakdown of percentages needed for the corresponding letter grades.
          Below is a breakdown of assignments and exams, their assigned weights and a brief description of
          each.
          Assignments (60%): Students will need to complete 5 or 6 assignments, each will have equal
          weightage. Some of the assignments will be based on implementation.
          Midterm Exam (20%): The midterm exam (in class) will be held in March. The date is not yet
          finalized. The details will be posted in Blackboard.
          Final Exam (20%): The final exam (in class) will be held on Tuesday, May 2, 2017. It will be
          comprehensive. More details will be posted in Blackboard.
          We will not have a separate course project for this course; rather, some of the assignments will be
          based on implementations of concepts taught in class and will be termed mini-projects. The mini-
          projects will have at least 30% weightage, so that MCS students can use this course for their MCS
          project portfolio.
          Absence & Make-Up Policies
          You are expected to submit all assignments on the due date. Late submissions will not be accepted.
          Students who expect to miss class due to officially university-sanctioned activities should inform
          the instructor early in the semester. Alternative arrangements will generally be made for any
          examinations and assignments affected by such absences.
          Classroom Behavior
          Cell phones must be turned off or set to vibrate during class to avoid causing distractions. Any
          violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student in this class will be reported to the ASU Police
          Department and the Office of the Dean of Students.
          Academic Integrity
          All students in this class are subject to ASU’s Academic Integrity Policy (available at
          http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity) and should acquaint themselves with its content and
          requirements, including a strict prohibition against plagiarism. All violations will be reported to
          the Dean’s office, who maintain records of all offenses. Specific rules for this class are as follows.
          All assignments and projects must be your own individual work, unless specified as team efforts.
          You are encouraged to learn from each other but copying is strongly discouraged. All solutions
          turned in for credit are to be your individual work and should demonstrate your problem solving
          skills. The instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing and to use his
          evaluation of the student's understanding of the assignment and of the submitted solution as
          evidence of cheating. Violators of this policy may be faced with penalties.
          Disability Accommodations
          Suitable accommodations will be made for students having disabilities and students should notify
          the instructor as early as possible if they will require same. Such students must be registered with
          the Disability Resource Center and provide documentation to that effect.
          Note: Any information in this syllabus may be subject to change with reasonable advance notice.
